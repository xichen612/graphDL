Graph deep learning

from GCN to GNN


## GCN
1. "CANE" (BLANE, CASE)

## GNN
1. "Neural Relational Inference for Interacting Systems"
2. "Relational inductive biasses, dep learning , and graph networks"

## Graph Embbedding
1. Node2Vec
2. Line: 
3. DeepWalk: Deploy a truncated random walk

## Method Comparison
- LINE vs DeepWalk
(1). DeepWalk does not provide a clear objective that articulates what net- work properties are preserved.
(2). DeepWalk only applies to unweighted networks
(3). DeepWalk expects nodes with higher second-order proximity yield similar low-dimensional representations, while the LINE preserves both first-order and second-order proximities.
